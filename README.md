## Introducing the project
For a company offering its users the opportunity to write comments, it's interesting to be able to know how to analyze the traces left by users on their platform.
The application is pretty straightforward: all you need to do is train a model capable of analysing text and classify it into several categories.
For each comment, it's up to you to determine the most plausible class.

## Instructions
- Create a Github directory and save your work regularly.
- Use this dataset for training.
- Start by training a very simple model to determine the difficulty of the problem.
- Progress iteratively towards a deep learning model using embedding and embedding and RNNs.
- Create a pipeline that takes a raw sentence as input, performs all processing processing and classification

## Tips
- Initially, take only a small portion of the data to reduce computation time.
- Reuse as many of the examples you've seen in previous tutorials as possible.
- Take inspiration from the code of others who have already solved this problem on Kaggle.
- Don't hesitate to look for help on the Internet.

## Result
### A notebook :
- available on your Github,
- a markdown summary must be set up at the beginning of the notebook.
- Each step must be justified using Markdown,
- The code must be clear and commented

### A report will be drawn up covering :
- the context and subject of the project,
- data and approach used,
- details of your solution,
- possible improvements to this version.
The report should be no longer than 5 pages.
The report and notebook must be sent by e-mail no later than midnight March 15.
